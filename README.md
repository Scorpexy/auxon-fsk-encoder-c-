# AUXON FSK Encoder

AUXON is an experimental ultrasonic communication system designed to transmit digital data using sound waves above the human hearing range.
This repo contains the C++ implementation of the FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) encoder, capable of converting text strings into ultrasonic audio signals.

This is the foundation for a real-time ultrasonic modem, which will be part of the broader AUXON system.
